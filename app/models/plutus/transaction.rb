module Plutus
  # Transactions are the recording of debits and credits to various accounts.
  # This table can be thought of as a traditional accounting Journal.
  #
  # Posting to a Ledger can be considered to happen automatically, since
  # Accounts have the reverse 'has_many' relationship to either it's credit or
  # debit transactions
  #
  # @example
  #   cash = Plutus::Asset.find_by_name('Cash')
  #   accounts_receivable = Plutus::Asset.find_by_name('Accounts Receivable')
  #
  #   debit_amount = Plutus::DebitAmount.new(:account => cash, :amount => 1000)
  #   credit_amount = Plutus::CreditAmount.new(:account => accounts_receivable, :amount => 1000)
  #
  #   transaction = Plutus::Transaction.new(:description => "Receiving payment on an invoice")
  #   transaction.debit_amounts << debit_amount
  #   transaction.credit_amounts << credit_amount
  #   transaction.save
