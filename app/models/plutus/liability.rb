    # The balance of the account.
    #
    # Liability accounts have normal credit balances, so the debits are subtracted from the credits
    # unless this is a contra account, in which credits are subtracted from debits
    #
    # @example
    #   >> liability.balance
    #   => #<BigDecimal:103259bb8,'0.2E4',4(12)>
    #
    # @return [BigDecimal] The decimal value balance
    def balance

    # This class method is used to return
    # the balance of all Liability accounts.
    #
    # Contra accounts are automatically subtracted from the balance.
    #
    # @example
    #   >> Plutus::Liability.balance
    #   => #<BigDecimal:1030fcc98,'0.82875E5',8(20)>
    #
    # @return [BigDecimal] The decimal value balance
