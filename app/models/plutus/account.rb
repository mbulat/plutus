module Plutus
  # The Account class represents accounts in the system. Each account must be subclassed as one of the following types:
  #
  #   TYPE        | NORMAL BALANCE    | DESCRIPTION
  #   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #   Asset       | Debit             | Resources owned by the Business Entity
  #   Liability   | Credit            | Debts owed to outsiders
  #   Equity      | Credit            | Owners rights to the Assets
  #   Revenue     | Credit            | Increases in owners equity
  #   Expense     | Debit             | Assets or services consumed in the generation of revenue
  #
  # Each account can also be marked as a "Contra Account". A contra account will have it's
  # normal balance swapped. For example, to remove equity, a "Drawing" account may be created
  # as a contra equity account as follows:
  #
  #   Plutus::Equity.create(:name => "Drawing", contra => true)
  #
  # At all times the balance of all accounts should conform to the "accounting equation"
  #   Plutus::Assets = Liabilties + Owner's Equity
  #
  # Each sublclass account acts as it's own ledger. See the individual subclasses for a
  # description.
  #
  # @abstract
  #   An account must be a subclass to be saved to the database. The Account class
  #   has a singleton method {trial_balance} to calculate the balance on all Accounts.
